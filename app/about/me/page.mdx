# About Me

Hello! I'm Dương Bảo Duy, a software engineer with 9 years of expertise in optimizing application performance and driving innovative solutions. My passion lies in bridging the gap between technology and human interaction, with a focus on making software more accessible and intuitive for everyone.

## My Journey

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics & Computer Science from Ho Chi Minh University of Science, where I developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computing. Over the years, I've worked with various companies including VNG Corp, Rever Corp, and have been freelancing as an AI Researcher, allowing me to gain diverse experience in different domains.

## Technical Expertise

My technical skills span across multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C/C++, Java, Objective-C, Dart, and Go. I have extensive experience with modern frameworks like Next.js and Flutter for frontend development, and FastAPI, Django, and Gin for backend systems.

I'm particularly interested in AI and machine learning, with hands-on experience in Whisper models, PyTorch, and developing language models for Vietnamese language support. Additionally, I have expertise in WebRTC for real-time communication, mobile development, and cloud technologies including Kubernetes for container orchestration.

## What Drives Me

I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technological trends. My approach to software development emphasizes clean, efficient, and maintainable code, combined with problem-solving and critical thinking skills. I'm fluent in English (working proficiency) and apply GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology to manage my projects efficiently.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy working on personal projects like my homelab where I host a Kubernetes cluster, exploring new technologies, and contributing to the tech community. Currently, I'm focused on AI research, particularly on fine-tuning models and adapting AI technologies for Vietnamese language applications.

Feel free to connect with me through my GitHub or website to learn more about my work and projects.
